Lift version 2.4 basic web application configured for sbt version 0.11.3
Following sbt plugins are included:
- xsbt-web-plugin
- sbt-idea
- sbteclipse-plugin

Simply run ./sbt to setup the project.
To start jetty, run container:start
To stop jetty, run container:stop
for continuus development run:

~; container:start; container:reload /

That example has following functionalities enabled:
1. dumb form processing
2. ajax form processing
3. json-ajax form processing
4. basic screen processing

More examples will be added in the future, those first four are just for begginers (as I am) trying 
to figure out how to do simple things in lift. Those basics are missing from the usual sources, like
lift's cookbook and simply.liftweb.net
